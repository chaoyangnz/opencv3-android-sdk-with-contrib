    u"@brief Computes the undistortion and rectification transformation map.\n\nThe function computes the joint undistortion and rectification transformation and represents the\nresult in the form of maps for remap. The undistorted image looks like original, as if it is\ncaptured with a camera using the camera matrix =newCameraMatrix and zero distortion. In case of a\nmonocular camera, newCameraMatrix is usually equal to cameraMatrix, or it can be computed by\ncv::getOptimalNewCameraMatrix for a better control over scaling. In case of a stereo camera,\nnewCameraMatrix is normally set to P1 or P2 computed by cv::stereoRectify .\n\nAlso, this new camera is oriented differently in the coordinate space, according to R. That, for\nexample, helps to align two heads of a stereo camera so that the epipolar lines on both images\nbecome horizontal and have the same y- coordinate (in case of a horizontally aligned stereo camera).\n\nThe function actually builds the maps for the inverse mapping algorithm that is used by remap. That\nis, for each pixel \\f$(u, v)\\f$ in the destination (corrected and rectified) image, the function\ncomputes the corresponding coordinates in the source image (that is, in the original image from\ncamera). The following process is applied:\n\\f[\n\\begin{array}{l}\nx  \\leftarrow (u - {c'}_x)/{f'}_x  \\\\\ny  \\leftarrow (v - {c'}_y)/{f'}_y  \\\\\n{[X\\,Y\\,W]} ^T  \\leftarrow R^{-1}*[x \\, y \\, 1]^T  \\\\\nx'  \\leftarrow X/W  \\\\\ny'  \\leftarrow Y/W  \\\\\nr^2  \\leftarrow x'^2 + y'^2 \\\\\nx''  \\leftarrow x' \\frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6}\n+ 2p_1 x' y' + p_2(r^2 + 2 x'^2)  + s_1 r^2 + s_2 r^4\\\\\ny''  \\leftarrow y' \\frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6}\n+ p_1 (r^2 + 2 y'^2) + 2 p_2 x' y' + s_3 r^2 + s_4 r^4 \\\\\ns\\vecthree{x'''}{y'''}{1} =\n\\vecthreethree{R_{33}(\\tau_x, \\tau_y)}{0}{-R_{13}((\\tau_x, \\tau_y)}\n{0}{R_{33}(\\tau_x, \\tau_y)}{-R_{23}(\\tau_x, \\tau_y)}\n{0}{0}{1} R(\\tau_x, \\tau_y) \\vecthree{x''}{y''}{1}\\\\\nmap_x(u,v)  \\leftarrow x''' f_x + c_x  \\\\\nmap_y(u,v)  \\leftarrow y''' f_y + c_y\n\\end{array}\n\\f]\nwhere \\f$(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6[, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4[, \\tau_x, \\tau_y]]]])\\f$\nare the distortion coefficients.\n\nIn case of a stereo camera, this function is called twice: once for each camera head, after\nstereoRectify, which in its turn is called after cv::stereoCalibrate.

    u"@brief Calculates the distance to the closest zero pixel for each pixel of the source image.\n\nThe function cv::distanceTransform calculates the approximate or precise distance from every binary\nimage pixel to the nearest zero pixel. For zero image pixels, the distance will obviously be zero.\n\nWhen maskSize == DIST_MASK_PRECISE and distanceType == DIST_L2 , the function runs the\nalgorithm described in @cite Felzenszwalb04 . This algorithm is parallelized with the TBB library.\n\nIn other cases, the algorithm @cite Borgefors86 is used. This means that for a pixel the function\nfinds the shortest path to the nearest zero pixel consisting of basic shifts: horizontal, vertical,\ndiagonal, or knight's move (the latest is available for a \\f$5\\times 5\\f$ mask). The overall\ndistance is calculated as a sum of these basic distances. Since the distance function should be\nsymmetric, all of the horizontal and vertical shifts must have the same cost (denoted as a ), all\nthe diagonal shifts must have the same cost (denoted as `b`), and all knight's moves must have the\nsame cost (denoted as `c`). For the cv::DIST_C and cv::DIST_L1 types, the distance is calculated\nprecisely, whereas for cv::DIST_L2 (Euclidean distance) the distance can be calculated only with a\nrelative error (a \\f$5\\times 5\\f$ mask gives more accurate results). For `a`,`b`, and `c`, OpenCV\nuses the values suggested in the original paper:\n- DIST_L1: `a = 1, b = 2`\n- DIST_L2:\n- `3 x 3`: `a=0.955, b=1.3693`\n- `5 x 5`: `a=1, b=1.4, c=2.1969`\n- DIST_C: `a = 1, b = 1`\n\nTypically, for a fast, coarse distance estimation DIST_L2, a \\f$3\\times 3\\f$ mask is used. For a\nmore accurate distance estimation DIST_L2, a \\f$5\\times 5\\f$ mask or the precise algorithm is used.\nNote that both the precise and the approximate algorithms are linear on the number of pixels.\n\nThis variant of the function does not only compute the minimum distance for each pixel \\f$(x, y)\\f$\nbut also identifies the nearest connected component consisting of zero pixels\n(labelType==DIST_LABEL_CCOMP) or the nearest zero pixel (labelType==DIST_LABEL_PIXEL). Index of the\ncomponent/pixel is stored in `labels(x, y)`. When labelType==DIST_LABEL_CCOMP, the function\nautomatically finds connected components of zero pixels in the input image and marks them with\ndistinct labels. When labelType==DIST_LABEL_CCOMP, the function scans through the input image and\nmarks all the zero pixels with distinct labels.\n\nIn this mode, the complexity is still linear. That is, the function provides a very fast way to\ncompute the Voronoi diagram for a binary image. Currently, the second variant can use only the\napproximate distance transform algorithm, i.e. maskSize=DIST_MASK_PRECISE is not supported\nyet.\n\n@param src 8-bit, single-channel (binary) source image.\n@param dst Output image with calculated distances. It is a 8-bit or 32-bit floating-point,\nsingle-channel image of the same size as src.\n@param labels Output 2D array of labels (the discrete Voronoi diagram).

In case of the DIST_L1 or DIST_C distance type,\nthe parameter is forced to 3 because a \\f$3\\times 3\\f$ mask gives the same result as \\f$5\\times\n5\\f$ or any larger aperture.\n@param labelType Type of the label array to build, see cv::DistanceTransformLabelTypes."]

Since this is both an input and output parameter, you must take responsibility\nof initializing it. Flood-filling cannot go across non-zero pixels in the input mask. For example,\nan edge detector output can be used as a mask to stop filling at edges. On output, pixels in the\nmask corresponding to filled pixels in the image are set to 1 or to the a value specified in flags\nas described below.

The first 8 bits contain a connectivity value. The default value of\n4 means that only the four nearest neighbor pixels (those that share an edge) are considered. A\nconnectivity value of 8 means that the eight nearest neighbor pixels (those that share a corner)\nwill be considered. The next 8 bits (8-16) contain a value between 1 and 255 with which to fill\nthe mask (the default value is 1). For example, 4 | ( 255 \\<\\< 8 ) will consider 4 nearest\nneighbours and fill the mask with a value of 255. The following additional options occupy higher\nbits and therefore may be further combined with the connectivity and mask fill values using\nbit-wise or (|), see cv::FloodFillFlags.\n\n@note Since the mask is larger than the filled image, a pixel \\f$(x, y)\\f$ in image corresponds to the\npixel \\f$(x+1, y+1)\\f$ in the mask .\n\n@sa findContours"]

    u'@brief Converts an image from one color space to another.\n\nThe function converts an input image from one color space to another. In case of a transformation\nto-from RGB color space, the order of the channels should be specified explicitly (RGB or BGR). Note\nthat the default color format in OpenCV is often referred to as RGB but it is actually BGR (the\nbytes are reversed). So the first byte in a standard (24-bit) color image will be an 8-bit Blue\ncomponent, the second byte will be Green, and the third byte will be Red. The fourth, fifth, and\nsixth bytes would then be the second pixel (Blue, then Green, then Red), and so on.\n\nThe conventional ranges for R, G, and B channel values are:\n-   0 to 255 for CV_8U images\n-   0 to 65535 for CV_16U images\n-   0 to 1 for CV_32F images\n\nIn case of linear transformations, the range does not matter. But in case of a non-linear\ntransformation, an input RGB image should be normalized to the proper value range to get the correct\nresults, for example, for RGB \\f$\\rightarrow\\f$ L\\*u\\*v\\* transformation. For example, if you have a\n32-bit floating-point image directly converted from an 8-bit image without any scaling, then it will\nhave the 0..255 value range instead of 0..1 assumed by the function. So, before calling cvtColor ,\nyou need first to scale the image down:\n@code\nimg *= 1./255;\ncvtColor(img, img, COLOR_BGR2Luv);\n@endcode\nIf you use cvtColor with 8-bit images, the conversion will have some information lost. For many\napplications, this will not be noticeable but it is recommended to use 32-bit images in applications\nthat need the full range of colors or that convert an image before an operation and then convert\nback.\n\nIf conversion adds the alpha channel, its value will set to the maximum of corresponding channel\nrange: 255 for CV_8U, 65535 for CV_16U, 1 for CV_32F.\n\n@param src input image: 8-bit unsigned, 16-bit unsigned ( CV_16UC... ), or single-precision\nfloating-point.\n@param dst output image of the same size and depth as src.\n@param code color space conversion code (see cv::ColorConversionCodes).\n@param dstCn number of channels in the destination image; if the parameter is 0, the number of the\nchannels is derived automatically from src and code.\n\n@see @ref imgproc_color_conversions']
